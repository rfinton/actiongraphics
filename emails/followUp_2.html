                    <div>Hi ##firstname##,</div>

                    <div>
                        <p>My name is Jesse Park and I work directly with many of our nonprofit clients on an array of fundraising campaigns here at Action Graphics.</p>
                        <p>A few weeks ago you requested access to our latest whitepaper <em>Three Definitive Ways to Retain Donors and Increase Engagement</em>. Hopefully you had some time since Fundraising Day to read through it, but I wanted to extend myself to you personally in case you had any lingering questions on the subject matter.</p>
                        <p>I really encourage you to <a href="##purl##.engagethedonor.com/landingpage2.html">take a look at our approach in action</a> or give me a call to talk about how we might be able to alleviate the challenges that ##organization## might be dealing with currently.</p>
                        <p>My contact info is below in case you want to connect.</p>
                        <p>All the best,</p>
                    </div>
